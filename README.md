## Investigate the TMDb movie dataset

This project was written for Udacityâ€™s Data Analyst nanodegree program. The primary goal is to investigate a dataset performing the entire data analysis process with **Python 3** and libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

The TMDb movie dataset was chosen for this purpose. This dataset, which was cleaned from original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), contains basic information about more than 10 thousand movies, produced between 1960 and 2015.

The scope of this project is very restrict, limited to discussing a few aspects of movies that can be considered a _**success**_. It is assumed that two variables can measure the success of a movie, **vote average scores** and **revenues**, although others can also be used for this purpose.
